# Running Bitcoin - How to Set Up a Pruned Node with Docker

In this post, we will walk through setting up a pruned Bitcoin node using Docker.

A pruned Bitcoin node stores only a subset of the blockchain data, allowing it to save storage space compared to a full node, which stores the entire blockchain. Despite storing less data, a pruned node still validates and shares transactions, contributing to the overall security and health of the Bitcoin network. Pruned nodes are a good option for users with limited storage resources who still want to participate in the network.

Using Docker containers has several benefits that can simplify the installation and deployment process when setting up a pruned Bitcoin node. It provides an isolated environment for running the node, making it easy to maintain and troubleshoot. Moreover, Docker allows you to deploy the node on various operating systems without worrying about compatibility issues, as the container includes all necessary dependencies.

It's important to note that pruning has some impact on the functionality of your node. A pruned node can no longer serve the full historical blockchain data to other nodes. However, it can still validate and relay new transactions and blocks, as well as serve recent blockchain data to other nodes, while still allowing you to interact with the Bitcoin network. This makes pruned nodes suitable for users with limited storage who still want to contribute to the network.

## 0. Prerequisites

Before starting, make sure you have the following software installed on your system:

1. Docker: Install the latest version of Docker from the [official website](https://www.docker.com/get-started/).

## 1. Create a Custom Dockerfile

We will begin by creating a custom Dockerfile that will set up a pruned Bitcoin node with the necessary configurations. This Dockerfile will use the Debian stable-slim base image and install Bitcoin Core from the official repository.

Create a new file called `Dockerfile` in your working directory and add the following content:

```
# Use a minimal Debian image as a base
FROM debian:stable-slim

# Set Bitcoin version
ARG BITCOIN_VERSION=24.0.1
ARG BITCOIN_URL=https://bitcoincore.org/bin/bitcoin-core-${BITCOIN_VERSION}/bitcoin-${BITCOIN_VERSION}-aarch64-linux-gnu.tar.gz

# Install required packages
RUN apt-get update && \
    apt-get install -y curl

# Download Bitcoin Core binaries
RUN curl -O $BITCOIN_URL && \
    tar -xzvf bitcoin-${BITCOIN_VERSION}-aarch64-linux-gnu.tar.gz && \
    install -m 0755 -o root -g root -t /usr/local/bin bitcoin-${BITCOIN_VERSION}/bin/*

# Expose Bitcoin Core's default ports
EXPOSE 8332 8333 18332 18333 18444

# Set working directory
WORKDIR /bitcoin

# Default command to start Bitcoin Core
CMD ["bitcoind", "-printtoconsole", "-prune=1000", "-assumevalid=00000000000000000003ee81c89560c98a1716c3bbc062fa938014ea6411d97c"]

```

Let's break down the lines in this Dockerfile:

1. `FROM debian:stable-slim`: This line specifies the base image for the Docker build.

2. `ENV BITCOIN_VERSION=24.0.1` and `ENV BITCOIN_URL=...`: These lines set environment variables for the Bitcoin Core version and download URL. Make sure that you are downloading a version of Bitcoin Core that is compatible with your host system.

3. `RUN apt-get update && apt-get install -y curl`: This line updates the package lists for upgrades and installs the necessary dependency (curl) required for downloading the Bitcoin Core binaries.

4. `RUN curl -O $BITCOIN_URL && ...`: This line downloads the specified Bitcoin Core binaries using the URL constructed from the given version. It then extracts the contents of the downloaded archive and installs the binary files to /usr/local/bin for easy access. Note that we have removed the verification process from the Dockerfile for simplicity, but you can perform a verification with checksums for additional security by referring to the Bitcoin Core documentation (https://bitcoincore.org/en/download/).

5. `WORKDIR /bitcoin`: This line sets the working directory inside the container to /bitcoin. All subsequent commands will be executed relative to this directory.

6. `EXPOSE 8332 8333 18332 18333 18443 18444`: This line tells Docker to expose the specified ports to the host machine, allowing the container to communicate with the outside world on these ports. These port numbers are essential for communication between your node and other nodes or applications. Here's a brief explanation of each Bitcoin port number used in the Dockerfile:

   - 8332: The default JSON-RPC port for the mainnet
   - 8333: The default P2P port for the mainnet, used for connecting to other nodes
   - 18332: The default JSON-RPC port for the testnet
   - 18333: The default P2P port for the testnet
   - 18443: The default JSON-RPC port for the regtest mode
   - 18444: The default P2P port for the regtest mode

7. `CMD ["bitcoind", "-prune=1000", "-assumevalid=<block_hash>", "-printtoconsole"]`: This line sets the default command to run when the container starts. In this case, it runs bitcoind with the following options:

   - `-prune=<n>`: This option enables you to run a pruned node by specifying the amount of disk space (in MiB) you want to allocate for storing the blockchain data. When this flag is set, the node will automatically prune the old blockchain data, keeping only the most recent blocks, up to the specified limit. In our case, `-prune=1000` means that your node will maintain around 1,000 MiB (or 1 GiB) of blockchain data, automatically removing older data as new blocks are added to the chain. This allows you to save storage space on your system while still being able to validate and share transactions with the Bitcoin network. For more information about pruning and the `-prune` flag, you can consult the [official Bitcoin Core documentation](https://bitcoin.org/en/full-node#reduce-storage).

   - `-assumevalid=<block_hash>`: This option tells Bitcoin Core to assume that the specified block (and its ancestors) is valid. Replace <block_hash> with an actual block hash to use this feature.

   - `-printtoconsole`: This option tells Bitcoin Core to output log messages to the console, which makes it easier to monitor the container's logs.

### Note on --assumevalid

The `--assumevalid` flag can be used to speed up the syncing process when setting up a pruned Bitcoin node. The `--assumevalid` flag is an optimization option in Bitcoin Core that allows you to trust a certain block hash without checking its signatures. This means that your node will assume that all transactions in the provided block and its ancestors are valid, and it won't verify their signatures.

By skipping signature verification for historical blocks, the initial sync time can be significantly reduced. However, using `--assumevalid` flag comes with some security trade-offs. While it's safe to use in most cases, especially when the block hash is from a trusted source or is hardcoded in the software, there is still a small chance that the block could be invalid or malicious. Therefore, you should only use this flag with a block hash that you trust.

You can find the latest `--assumevalid` block hash from a trusted source in the Bitcoin community (such as [blockchain.com](https://www.blockchain.com/explorer/blocks/btc?page=1))

When using `--assumevalid`, remember that it's only an optimization, and your node will still download and validate the entire blockchain, except for the signatures in the blocks up to the specified --assumevalid block.

The time saved by forgoing validation for signatures in the blocks up to the specified `--assumevalid` block can vary based on factors such as the hardware you're using, the quality of your internet connection, and the number of transactions and blocks being skipped. In general, signature verification is a CPU-intensive process, so using the `--assumevalid` flag can potentially save you hours or even days of sync time, depending on the block height.

It's essential to be cautious when using the `--assumevalid` flag. If you mistakenly trust a malicious or invalid block hash, your node might accept invalid transactions and operate on a different version of the blockchain. This could lead to financial losses or exposure to various attack vectors. Therefore, always double-check the block hash from multiple trusted sources before using it with the `--assumevalid` flag.

## 2. Build the Docker Image

Now, build the Docker image by running the following command in the same directory as your Dockerfile:

```
docker build -t pruned-bitcoin-node .
```

This command builds a Docker image named "pruned-bitcoin-node" using the Dockerfile located in the current directory. It assigns a tag to the image with `-t`, which makes it easier to reference and manage the image later.

## 3. Create a bitcoin.conf File

Create a `bitcoin.conf` file in your working directory with the desired configurations for pruning and the `--assumevalid` flag. For example:

```
prune=1000
assumevalid=<block_hash>
```

Replace `<block_hash>` with a trusted block hash.

## 4. Create a Bitcoin Data Directory

Create a directory on your host machine to store the Bitcoin data:

```
mkdir ~/bitcoin-data
```

Copy your `bitcoin.conf` file to this new directory:

```
cp bitcoin.conf ~/bitcoin-data/
```

## 5. Run the Docker Container

Run the Docker container using the built image, and bind the local Bitcoin data directory to the container:

```
docker run -d --name pruned-bitcoin-node -v ~/bitcoin-data:/bitcoin/ -p 8332:8332 -p 8333:8333 pruned-bitcoin-node
```

This command will start a Docker container with the pruned Bitcoin node, expose the necessary ports, and bind your local Bitcoin data directory to the container.

We use several flags to configure the container:

- `-d`: This flag runs the container in detached mode, which means the container will run in the background without occupying the command line.

- `--name pruned-bitcoin-node`: This flag assigns the human-friendly name "pruned-bitcoin-node" to the container, making it easier to reference in other Docker commands.

- `-v ~/bitcoin-data:/bitcoin/`: This flag creates a volume mapping, which links the local directory `~/bitcoin-data` to the container's internal directory `/bitcoin/`. It ensures that the blockchain data is stored on your host machine, making it persistent even if the container is removed.

- `-p 8332:8332 -p 8333:8333`: These flags map the container's port 8332 and port 8333 to the host machine's corresponding ports, allowing communication with the Bitcoin network.

- `pruned-bitcoin-node`: This is the name of the Docker image that the container is being created from. We built this image in the "Build the Docker Image" section with the command `docker build -t pruned-bitcoin-node .`.

**Checking Sync Status**: To check if your pruned Bitcoin node has completed the initial sync with the network, you can use the `bitcoin-cli` command-line tool within the Docker container. Run the following command:

```
docker exec -it pruned-bitcoin-node bitcoin-cli getblockchaininfo
```

This command will return information about the current state of your node's blockchain. Look for the "initialblockdownload" field in the output. If the value is false, that means your node has completed the initial sync. Additionally, you can monitor the progress by comparing the "blocks" value to the latest block height, which can be found on various Bitcoin block explorers.

Additionally, you can monitor initial syncing progress by navigating to the pruned-bitcoin-node Docker container's logs. This will display each block being validated in real time.

**Note on Real-Time Updates**: The pruned Bitcoin node you've set up will receive up-to-date information from network peers in real time, including new transactions and mined blocks. This real-time synchronization depends on your node staying connected to the network, which requires the Docker container to keep running. Make sure the container is running by periodically checking its status using `docker ps`. This command lists all running containers, and you should see your `pruned-bitcoin-node` container in the list. If the container stops running for any reason, restart it with `docker start pruned-bitcoin-node`. By keeping your Docker container up and running, your pruned Bitcoin node will stay connected to its peers and maintain an up-to-date view of the blockchain.

## 6. Interacting with the Bitcoin Node

The bitcoin-cli is a command-line tool that comes with the Bitcoin Core software. It allows you to interact with your Bitcoin node, manage settings, and execute various commands to monitor and control the node's behavior. In this section, we will demonstrate how to use bitcoin-cli to interact with your Bitcoin node using common commands. Keep in mind that with a pruned node, there may be some limitations when trying to access information about older blocks or transactions that are not part of recent blocks or the memory pool.

Here are some simple read-only commands that a user can perform once they have set up a pruned Bitcoin node in Docker:

a. **Get blockchain information**: Use the `getblockchaininfo` command to display general information about the current state of the blockchain.

```
docker exec -it pruned-bitcoin-node bitcoin-cli getblockchaininfo
```

b. **Get network information**: Use the `getnetworkinfo` command to display information about the node's connection to the Bitcoin network.

```
docker exec -it pruned-bitcoin-node bitcoin-cli getnetworkinfo
```

c. **Get connected peers**: Use the `getpeerinfo` command to display data about all the peers your node is connected to, including their IP addresses, user agent strings, and more.

```
docker exec -it pruned-bitcoin-node bitcoin-cli getpeerinfo
```

d. **Get mempool information**: Use the `getmempoolinfo` command to display information about the node's transaction memory pool.

```
docker exec -it pruned-bitcoin-node bitcoin-cli getmempoolinfo
```

e. **Get mining information**: Use the `getmininginfo` command to display information related to the node's mining capabilities.

```
docker exec -it pruned-bitcoin-node bitcoin-cli getmininginfo
```

f. **Get block information**: Use the `getblock` command to dispaly information about a specific block. Replace `<block_hash>` with the actual hash of the block you want to query.

```
docker exec -it pruned-bitcoin-node bitcoin-cli getblock <block_hash>
```

g. **Get transaction information**: Use the `getrawtransaction` command followed by the `decoderawtransaction` command to display detailed information about a specific transaction. Replace `<transaction_id>` with the actual transaction ID you want to query.

```
docker exec -it pruned-bitcoin-node bitcoin-cli getrawtransaction <transaction_id>
docker exec -it pruned-bitcoin-node bitcoin-cli decoderawtransaction <raw_transaction>
```

Please note that the `getrawtransaction` command may only work for transaction that are part of recent blocks or reside in the memory pool. With a pruned node, some transactions may not be available if they are part of older blocks that have been pruned.

h. **Get a block hash by height**: Use the `getblockhash` command to get the hash of a block at a specific height. Replace `<block_height>` with the actual height of the block you want to query.

```
docker exec -it pruned-bitcoin-node bitcoin-cli getblockhash <block_height>
```
