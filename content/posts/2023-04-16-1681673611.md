This guide will provide you with a complete introduction to installing, setting up, and interacting with PostgreSQL databases locally using Postgres.app for macOS.

## 1. Installation and Setup
### 1.1 Download and Install Postgres.app
1. Go to the official website https://postgresapp.com/ and download the latest version of Postgres.app.
2. Open the downloaded file and drag the Postgres.app into your Applications folder
3. Double click the Postgres.app icon to launch it.

### 1.2. Add `psql` to your `PATH`
To access the `psql` command-line interface from any location in the terminal, you need to add the Postgress.app's `bin` folder to your `PATH`.
1. Configure your $PATH to use the included command line tools (optional):
```bash
sudo mkdir -p /etc/paths.d &&
echo /Applications/Postgres.app/Contents/Versions/latest/bin | sudo tee /etc/paths.d/postgresapp
```

## 2. Basic Operations
### 2.1 Create a Database
To create a new database, you can use the `CREATE DATABASE` command in the `psql` CLI. First, open a terminal and connect to the `psql` CLI by running:
```bash
psql -U postgres
```

Then, run the `CREATE DATABASE` command to create a new database named `testdb`. Make sure to end the statement with a semi-colon (necessary for SQL commands):
```sql
CREATE DATABASE testdb;
```

You should see a confirmation message that the database has been created. To list all available databases, use the `\list` command in the `psql` CLI:
```bash
\list
```

### 2.2 Delete a Database
To delete a database, use the `DROP DATABASE` command. First, ensure you are not connected to the database you want to delete. Connect to another database, such as default `postgres` database:
```bash
\c postgres
```
Then, run `DROP DATABASE` command to delete the `testdb` database:
```sql
DROP DATABASE testdb;
```

### 2.3 Create a Table
To create a table, first connect to the desired database:
```bash
\c testdb
```

Then, use the `CREATE TABLE` command to create a new table. For example, to create a table names `users` with `id`, `name`, and `email` columns:
```sql
CREATE TABLE users (
  id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
  name VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL,
  email VARCHAR(100) UNIQUE NOT NULL
);
```
Use the `\dt` command to list all the tables in the connected database:
```bash
\dt
```

### 2.4 Insert Data into a Table
To insert data into the `users` table, use the `INSERT INTO` command:
```sql
INSERT INTO users (name, email) VALUES ('John Doe', 'john.doe@example.com');
```

### 2.5 Query Data from a Table
To query data from the `users` table, use the `SELECT` command:
```sql
SELECT * FROM users;
```

### 2.6 Updata Data in a Table
To update data in the `users` table, use the `UPDATE` command. For example, to update the email of a user with the `id` of 1:
```sql
UPDATE users SET email = 'john.new@example.com' WHERE id = 1;
```

### 2.7 Delete Data from a Table
To delete data from the `users` talbe, use the `DELETE` command. For example, to delete the user with the `id` of 1:
```sql
DELETE FROM users WHERE id = 1;
```

### 2.8 Modify Table Structure
To modify the structure of a table, use the `ALTER TABLE` command. For example, to add a `birthdate` column to the `users` table:
```sql
ALTER TABLE users ADD COLUMN birthdate DATE;
```

To remove a column, use the `DROP COLUMN` clause with `ALTER TABLE`. For example, to remove the `birthdate` column:
```sql
ALTER TABLE users DROP COLUMN birthdate;
```

## 3. Conclusion
This guide provides a comprehensive introduction to installing and using Postgres.app to manage PostgreSQL databases locally. By following the outlined steps, you'll be able to create, delete, update, view, and modify database tables using both the `psql` CLI.
