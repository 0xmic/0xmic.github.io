Back in 2015, I was walking through Lake Lagunita one early evening. Yes, walking, as Lake Lag stopped being filled by the university in 2001 and henceforth became a dried up pit of a field.

Alone in the center of the field, I came across 2 chairs sitting side by side - one wooden dorm chair, one mesh pool recliner. The scene was a perfect dichotomy - the rigidity of the wooden chair reflecting against the lounginess of the recliner. A sunset backdrop accentuated their differences, making for a beautiful photograph that, unfortunately, has since been lost.

The contrasting chairs side by side, both misplaced and purposeful, resonated with me. Perhaps a metaphor for our desire to harmonize work and play.

I've always thought that if I started a band that lost photo would've made a great album cover for an album called Leisure Formal. Sadly, for now, no band, just a blog. That said, I'd like to embody a similar theme here - work, play, both, neither.

Before leaving, I spent some time sitting in both.
